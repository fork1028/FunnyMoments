Almost every TV shows, movies, and anime have funny moments, which add a bit of a taste in the piece. 

What it does
FunnyMoments enables users to import an anime clip, identifies and selects funny moments, take screenshots, and output the funny moments captured in the video as pictures.

The project consists of two major parts.

Machine Learning
